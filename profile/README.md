Justice Through Code is an ecosystem of career accelerators that takes Fellows from their first job to careers earning in excess of $100k a year through 3 tiered programs over 2 years.   We envision a world where the family or community a child is born into is no longer predictive of their likelihood of incarceration, and where every person, regardless of past convictions can access family-sustaining careers.   We achieve this vision by interrupting the generational cycles of poverty that contribute to incarceration and recidivism. We educate and nurture low-income talent with conviction histories to create a more just and diverse workforce. We increase workplace equity by creating pathways to careers that end the cycle of poverty which contributes to incarceration and recidivism.  We achieve these priorities through a tiered ecosystem of career accelerators that meets Fellowsâ€™ current needs in their journey to a family-sustaining career.
